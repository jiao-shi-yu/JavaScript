# Iterators

## 1. Introduction to Iterators

Imagine you had a grocery list and you wanted to know what each item on the list was. You’d have to scan through each row and check for the item. This common task is similar to what we have to do when we want to iterate over, or loop through, an array. One tool at our disposal is the `for` loop. However, we also have access to built-in array methods which make looping easier.

The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called *iteration methods*, at times referred to as *iterators*. **Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate elements and return values.**

In this lesson, you will learn the syntax for these methods, their return values, how to use the documentation to understand them, and how to choose the right iterator method for a given task.



### Instructions

Inspect the code in **main.js**. Notice the different methods being called on the arrays:

- `.forEach()`
- `.map()`
- `.filter()`

Run the code to see the output!

```js
const artists = ['Picasso', 'Kahlo', 'Matisse', 'Utamaro'];

artists.forEach(artist => {
  console.log(artist + ' is one of my favorite artists.');
});

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squareNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squareNumbers);

const things = ['desk', 'chair', 5, 'backpack', 3.14, 100];

const onlyNumbers = things.filter(thing => {
  return typeof thing === 'number';
});

console.log(onlyNumbers);
```



## 2. The .forEach() Method

The first iteration method that we’re going to learn is `.forEach()`. Aptly named, `.forEach()` will execute the same code for each element of an array.
![](../image/iterator%20anatomy.svg)

The code above will log a nicely formatted list of the groceries to the console. Let’s explore the syntax of invoking `.forEach()`.

- `groceries.forEach()` calls the `forEach` method on the `groceries` array.
- `.forEach()` takes an argument of callback function. Remember, a callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function.
- `.forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.
- The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.

Another way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax.

```js
groceries.forEach(groceryItem => console.log(groceryItem));
```

We can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.

```js
function printGrocery(element){
  console.log(element);
}
 
groceries.forEach(printGrocery);
```

The above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well.

All three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator. It’s good to be aware of the different ways to pass in callback functions as arguments in iterators because developers have different stylistic preferences. Nonetheless, due to the strong adoption of ES6, we will be using arrow function syntax in the later exercises.



### Instructions

```JS
const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below

```



**1.**

Iterate over the `fruits` array to log `I want to eat a` plus the name of each fruit to the console. For example, `I want to eat a mango`.

```js
const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log('I want to eat a ' + fruit));
```





## 3. The .map() Method

The second iterator we’re going to cover is `.map()`. When `.map()` is called on an array, it takes an argument of a callback function and returns a new array! Take a look at an example of calling `.map()`:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
 
const bigNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * 10;
});
```

`.map()` works in a similar manner to `.forEach()`— the major difference is that `.map()` returns a new array.

In the example above:

- `numbers` is an array of numbers.
- `bigNumbers` will store the return value of calling `.map()` on `numbers`.
- `numbers.map` will iterate through each element in the `numbers` array and pass the element into the callback function.
- `return number * 10` is the code we wish to execute upon each element in the array. This will save each value from the `numbers` array, multiplied by `10`, to a new array.

If we take a look at `numbers` and `bigNumbers`:

```js
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(bigNumbers); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Notice that the elements in `numbers` were not altered and `bigNumbers` is a new array.



### Instructions

```js
const animals = ['Hen', 'elephant', 'llama', 'leopard', 'ostrich', 'Whale', 'octopus', 'rabbit', 'lion', 'dog'];

// Create the secretMessage array below


console.log(secretMessage.join(''));

const bigNumbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

// Create the smallNumbers array below

```



**1.**

Add your code under the `animals` array and before the line `console.log(secretMessage.join(''));`

Use `.map()` to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the `animals` array. Save the new array to a `const` variable named `secretMessage`.

```js
const animals = ['Hen', 'elephant', 'llama', 'leopard', 'ostrich', 'Whale', 'octopus', 'rabbit', 'lion', 'dog'];

// Create the secretMessage array below
const secretMessage = animals.map(animal => animal[0]);

console.log(secretMessage.join('')); // HelloWorld
```



**2.**

Use `.map()` to divide all the numbers in `bigNumbers` by `100`. Save the returned values to a variable declared with `const` called `smallNumbers`.

```js
const bigNumbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

// Create the smallNumbers array below
const smallNumbers = bigNumbers.map(number => number / 100);
```



## 4. The .filter() Method

Another useful iterator method is `.filter()`. Like `.map()`, `.filter()` returns a new array. However, `.filter()` returns an array of elements after filtering out certain elements from the original array. The callback function for the `.filter()` method should return `true` or `false` depending on the element that is passed to it. The elements that cause the callback function to return `true` are added to the new array. Take a look at the following example:

```js
const words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 
 
const shortWords = words.filter(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
});
```

- `words` is an array that contains string elements.
- `const shortWords =` declares a new variable that will store the returned array from invoking `.filter()`.
- The callback function is an arrow function has a single parameter, `word`. Each element in the `words` array will be passed to this function as an argument.
- `word.length < 6;` is the condition in the callback function. Any `word` from the `words` array that has fewer than `6` characters will be added to the `shortWords` array.

Let’s also check the values of `words` and `shortWords`:

```js
console.log(words); // Output: ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 
console.log(shortWords); // Output: ['chair', 'music', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']
```

Observe how `words` was not mutated, i.e. changed, and `shortWords` is a new array.



### Instructions

```js
const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below


const favoriteWords = ['nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'fervent', 'esoteric', 'serene'];


// Call .filter() on favoriteWords below


```



**1.**

Call the `.filter()` method on `randomNumbers` to return values that are less than `250`. Save them to a new array called `smallNumbers`, declared with `const`.

```js
const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below
const smallNumbers = randomNumbers.filter(number => number < 250);

const favoriteWords = ['nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'fervent', 'esoteric', 'serene'];


// Call .filter() on favoriteWords below


```



**2.**

Now let’s work with an array of strings. Invoke `.filter()` on the `favoriteWords` array to return elements that have more than 7 characters. Save the returned array to a `const` variable named `longFavoriteWords`.

```js
const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below
const smallNumbers = randomNumbers.filter(number => number < 250);

const favoriteWords = ['nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'fervent', 'esoteric', 'serene'];


// Call .filter() on favoriteWords below
const longFavoriteWords = favoriteWords.filter(word => word.length > 7);
```





## 5. The .findIndex() Method

We sometimes want to find the location of an element in an array. That’s where the `.findIndex()` method comes in! Calling `.findIndex()` on an array will return the index of the first element that evaluates to `true` in the callback function.  Jumbled 错杂的 乱蓬蓬的

```js
const jumbledNums = [123, 25, 78, 5, 9]; 
 
const lessThanTen = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num < 10;
});
```

- `jumbledNums` is an array that contains elements that are numbers.
- `const lessThanTen =` declares a new variable that stores the returned index number from invoking `.findIndex()`.
- The callback function is an arrow function that has a single parameter, `num`. Each element in the `jumbledNums` array will be passed to this function as an argument.
- `num < 10;` is the condition that elements are checked against. `.findIndex()` will return the index of the first element which evaluates to `true` for that condition.

Let’s take a look at what `lessThanTen` evaluates to:

```js
console.log(lessThanTen); // Output: 3 
```

If we check what element has index of 3:

```js
console.log(jumbledNums[3]); // Output: 5
```

Great, the element in index `3` is the number `5`. This makes sense since `5` is the first element that is less than 10.

If there isn’t a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then `.findIndex()` will return `-1`.

```js
const greaterThan1000 = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num > 1000;
});
 
console.log(greaterThan1000); // Output: -1
```



### Instructions

```js
const animals = ['hippo', 'tiger', 'lion', 'seal', 'cheetah', 'monkey', 'salamander', 'elephant'];
```



**1.**

Invoke `.findIndex()` on the `animals` array to find the index of the element that has the value `'elephant'` and save the returned value to a `const` variable named `foundAnimal`.

```js
const animals = ['hippo', 'tiger', 'lion', 'seal', 'cheetah', 'monkey', 'salamander', 'elephant'];

const foundAnimal = animals.findIndex(animal => animal === 'elephant');
```



**2.**

Let’s see if we can find the index of the first animal that starts with the letter `'s'`.

Call `.findIndex()` on the animals array return the index of the first element that starts with `'s'`. Assign the returned value to a `const` variable named `startsWithS`.

```js
const animals = ['hippo', 'tiger', 'lion', 'seal', 'cheetah', 'monkey', 'salamander', 'elephant'];

const foundAnimal = animals.findIndex(animal => animal === 'elephant');

const startsWithS = animals.findIndex(animal => animal.startsWith('s'));
```



## 6. The .reduce() Method

Another widely used iteration method is `.reduce()`. The `.reduce()` method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby *reducing* the array. Take a look at the example below:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];
 
const summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue
})
 
console.log(summedNums) // Output: 17
```

Here are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array:

| Iteration | `accumulator` | `currentValue` | return value |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| First     | 1             | 2              | 3            |
| Second    | 3             | 4              | 7            |
| Third     | 7             | 10             | 17           |



Now let’s go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above:

- `numbers` is an array that contains numbers.
- `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`.
- `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument.
- The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above.
- As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process.

The `.reduce()` method can also take an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!). For instance:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];
 
const summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue
}, 100)  // <- Second argument for .reduce()
 
console.log(summedNums); // Output: 117
```

Here’s an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`:

| Iteration # | `accumulator` | `currentValue` | return value |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| First       | 100           | 1              | 101          |
| Second      | 101           | 2              | 103          |
| Third       | 103           | 4              | 107          |
| Fourth      | 107           | 10             | 117          |





### Instructions

**1.**

Let’s practice calling `.reduce()` and using `console.log()` to check the values as `.reduce()` iterates through the array.

In **main.js**, there is an array of numbers, `newNumbers`.

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];
```



To start, declare a new variable named `newSum` using the `const` keyword. Assign to `newSum` the value of calling `.reduce()` on `newNumbers`. You don’t need to provide any arguments to `.reduce()` yet.

You’ll also see a `TypeError: undefined is not a function` but we’ll fix that after we add our callback function in the next step!

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum = newNumbers.reduce();
```



**2.**

Provide `.reduce` with an argument of a callback function. The callback function has two parameters. The first parameter is `accumulator` and the second parameter is `currentValue`. Use either a function expression or an arrow function.

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum = newNumbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {

});
```



**3.**

To check the value being used as we iterate through the array, add three statements to the function body of the callback:

- `console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);`
- `console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);`
- a return statement that adds `accumulator` to `currentValue`.

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum = newNumbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
	console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);
  console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);
  return accumulator + currentValue;
});
```



**4.**

Log the value of `newSum` to the console to see the return value of calling `.reduce()` on `newNumbers`.

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum = newNumbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
	console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);
  console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);
  return accumulator + currentValue;
});
console.log(newSum);
```



**5.**

While we have this code set up, let’s also check what happens if you add a second argument to `.reduce()`. The second argument acts as an initial value for the `accumulator`.

Add a second argument of `10` to `.reduce()`.

```js
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum = newNumbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
	console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);
  console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 10);
console.log(newSum);
```



## 7. Iterator Documentation

There are many additional built-in array methods, a complete list of which is on the [MDN’s Array iteration methods page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods).

The documentation for each method contains several sections:

1. A short definition.
2. A block with the correct syntax for using the method.
3. A list of parameters the method accepts or requires.
4. The return value of the function.
5. An extended description.
6. Examples of the method’s use.
7. Other additional information.

In the instructions below, there are some errors in the code. Use the documentation for a given method to determine the error or fill in a blank to make the code run correctly.



### Instructions

```js
const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some(() => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array



// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

// console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => { } ));

```



**1.**

In the code editor, there is an array called `words`. We want to create a new array of interesting words. The first thing we want to do is check if there are words that are fewer than `6` characters long. There is something missing in the `words.some()` method call. Fix this method so that `true` is printed to the console.

For more information browse [MDN’s documentation on `.some()` ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some).

```js
console.log(words.some((word) => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));
```



**2.**

The `.some()` method returned `true`, which means there are some words in the array that are shorter than six characters. Use the `.filter()` method to save any words longer than `5` characters to a new variable called `interestingWords`, declared with `const`.

We’ve used `.filter()` in a previous exercise, but, for more information browse [MDN’s documentation on `.filter()` ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).

```js
const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some((word) => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 5);


```







**3.**

In the last line of **main.js**, there is this code:

```
// console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>        ));
```

Complete the code between the parentheses to check if every element has more than 5 characters.

Make sure to uncomment (delete the `//` before) the last line of the program before you run the code.

For more information browse [MDN’s documentation on `.every()` ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every).

```js
const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some((word) => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 5);

// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => {
  return word.length > 5;
} ));



```



## 8. Choose the Right Iterator

There are many iteration methods you can choose. In addition to learning the correct syntax for the use of iteration methods, it is also important to learn how to choose the correct method for different scenarios. The exercises below will give you the opportunity to do just that!

You’ll see errors pop up in the terminal as you work through this exercise, but by the end the errors will be gone!



### Instructions

```js
const cities = ['Orlando', 'Dubai', 'Edinburgh', 'Chennai', 'Accra', 'Denver', 'Eskisehir', 'Medellin', 'Yokohama'];

const nums = [1, 50, 75, 200, 350, 525, 1000];

//  Choose a method that will return undefined
cities.method(city => console.log('Have you visited ' + city + '?'));

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const longCities = cities.method(city => city.length > 7);

// Choose a method that will return a single value
const word = cities.method((acc, currVal) => {
  return acc + currVal[0]
}, "C");

console.log(word)

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const smallerNums = nums.method(num => num - 5);

// Choose a method that will return a boolean value
nums.method(num => num < 0);

```



**1.**

Replace the word `method` in the first method call with a method that will do something to each of the values in the array and return `undefined`.

**2.**

In the second method call, replace the word `method` with a method that will return a new array with only those elements longer than `7` characters.

**3.**

In the third method call, replace the word `method` with a method that take an array that contains multiple values and returns a single value.

**4.**

In the fourth method call, replace the word `method` with a method that will return a new array of numbers returned from the function.

**5.**

In the fifth method call, replace the word `method` with a method that will return a boolean value.

```js
const cities = ['Orlando', 'Dubai', 'Edinburgh', 'Chennai', 'Accra', 'Denver', 'Eskisehir', 'Medellin', 'Yokohama'];

const nums = [1, 50, 75, 200, 350, 525, 1000];

//  Choose a method that will return undefined
cities.forEach(city => console.log('Have you visited ' + city + '?'));

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const longCities = cities.filter(city => city.length > 7);

// Choose a method that will return a single value
const word = cities.reduce((acc, currVal) => {
  return acc + currVal[0]
}, "C");

console.log(word)

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const smallerNums = nums.map(num => num - 5);

// Choose a method that will return a boolean value
nums.some(num => num < 0);


```



## 9. Review

Awesome job on clearing the iterators lesson! You have learned a number of useful methods in this lesson as well as how to use the JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network to discover and understand additional methods. Let’s review!

- `.forEach()` is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns `undefined`.
- `.map()` executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
- `.filter()` checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
- `.findIndex()` returns the index of the first element of an array which satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns `-1` if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.
- `.reduce()` iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.
- All iterator methods takes a callback function that can be pre-defined, or a function expression, or an arrow function.
- You can visit the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).



### Instructions

If you want to challenge yourself:

- Define a callback function before you use it in a iterator.
- Chain two iteration methods on the same array.
- Use the optional arguments in an iterator to include the index or the entire array. (Check out [MDN’s Array iteration methods page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods) for more information)
- Use `.reduce()` to take a multi-layered array and return a single layer array from scratch.
